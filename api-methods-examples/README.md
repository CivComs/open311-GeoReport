These are example JSON responses for the methods defined in api-methods.json. They are read by the bin/mk-api-docs.py program and are stored as separate files because the API spec is a JSON file and JSON doesn't allow unescaped newlines or tabs and it's just easier to keep the two (the spec and example responses) independent of one another.

None of these examples are complete as of this writing (20111010).
